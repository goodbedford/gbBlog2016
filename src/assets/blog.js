        "body": "<span class='blog-detail__highlight'>Dev Color </span> is a great place to find if you are looking to get involved in Tech Inclusion. I joined <a class='blog-detail__link' ng-href='https://www.devcolor.org/'>Dev Color</a> January 2017 after being on a waiting list for over half a year. I applied in October and was excepted in December. The quick version is we are a group of black software engineers who meet on a monthly basis in order to help each other meet our personaland career goals. These monthly meetings are truely helping me redefine my career trajectory. A lot of what we discuss is private which enables us to really open up. I am learning a lot about management, career paths and organization structures. So far my best time in Tech, since graduating from my General Assembly."

        "body": "<a class='blog-detail__link' ng-href='http://www.developerweek.com/'>Developer Week 2016</a> was fun enough to go. I saw a lot of alumni and they mentioned a few good talks. My buddy Angelo thought <a class='blog-detail__link' ng-href='http://www.benmvp.com/'>Ben Ilegbodu</a> was particularly awesome. I will have to look for his talk online. It was about <a class='blog-detail__link' ng-href='https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/'>es6 or es2015</a>, you be the judge. I was enjoying meeting new people but was somewhat sensitive to the banging house music and the crowds were a little scary. I can only image how it was for someone with more sensitivity to crazy noise and overcrowded spaces. I am going to <span class='blog-detail__highlight'>another career fair</span> TechUP in two weeks. I already like the setup, all the job seekers have time slots. I assume this will help manage the crowds. That's what you call great UX. Almost as good as this <a class='blog-detail__link' ng-href='https://image-store.slidesharecdn.com/bc9d69bc-a389-4117-af2f-b3ac8f23e3b8-original.jpeg'>image.</a>"

I hope to always be inspired and humbled by our work. The programming community is large and small much like San Francisco and the Bay Area. I was at a meet up at <a class='blog-detail__link' ng-href='http://www.hackreactor.com/program'>HR</a> for <a class='blog-detail__link' ng-href='http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/'>Ionic</a> with my instructor from <a class='blog-detail__link' ng-href='https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive' >GA</a>. We got to hear some great announcements Ionic Market Place and Ionic 2. It seems like version 2 is right on time for <a class='blog-detail__link' ng-href='https://angular.io/docs/js/latest/guide/'> Angular 2</a>. Ionic 2 had mostly the same components with enhanced physics and improved performance. Max didn’t give a hard timetable but hinted about shorter Alpha and Beta timelines. I think Ionic is powerful because it brings a <span class='blog-detail__highlight'>whole new dimension to being a web developer</span>. <a class='blog-detail__link' ng-href='http://johnpolacek.github.io/scrolldeck.js/decks/responsive/'> Mobile First</a> developers can actually put apps up on <a class='blog-detail__link' ng-href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id375380948?mt=8'>Apple Store </a>and <a class='blog-detail__link' ng-href='https://play.google.com/store/apps?hl=en'> Google Play</a>. That opens up so many possibilities.  I need to work on an Ionic projectSpec and give it a spin. I also want to give a shot out to the opening speaker <a class='blog-detail__link' ng-href='https://blog.nraboy.com/'> Nic Raboy</a>. He gave a live coding demo of an Ionic app. He also spoke about an interesting NoSql database <a class='blog-detail__link' ng-href='http://www.couchbase.com/'> Couchbase DB</a>. He said they are currently looking to <a class='blog-detail__link' ng-href='http://www.couchbase.com/careers'>hire</a> but what I really found interesting was his <a class='blog-detail__link' ng-href='https://blog.nraboy.com/2015/07/my-first-year-of-blogging-and-the-stats-around-it/'> blog</a>. He has some really tight posts. All in all a good day."

In my school, I am going to  learn Javascript and Ruby.  I will also learn the Rails, Angular, Express, Node, Mongo DB, PostgreSql, and testing in Mocha.  I am also interested in Famous.js, React.js and ES6 compilers like Babel. I don’t want to get stuck in liking everything new and not mastering the current. It will be a twelve week intensive program. I need to have a job at the other end.  I have quit both my jobs making over let's just say 75 grand to go back to school. I am honestly giving it my best chance. Wish me luck. "

Not that thought but I walked in and the front was very low key. I missed the first time up the block. I liked that quality. The thing that got me most, I saw people I saw on the internet. Amazing. I mean I saw someone who answered the online group video conference question. Peace, I gotta go put in work. "
